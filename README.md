The objective of this scientific research is to carry out an analysis of the forecast value of computer hardware shares in the New York – USA market, thus carrying out an analysis to verify whether the use of technical indicators provides results close to the reality results in relation to the use the value of the share itself. To predict the results, Machine Learning techniques will be used, specifically LSTM. The technical indicators to be evaluated in the research will be CCI (“Commodity Chanel Index”), RSI (“Relative Strength Index”), MACD (“Moving Average Convergence/Divergence”), Parabolic SAR and Bollinger Bands. In this research, the ARIMA model will also be used as a classical (statistical) method to make predictions.
